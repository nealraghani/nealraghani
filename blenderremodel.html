<p><b>Description:</b> "Slow Burn" is an Art 75 project that makes use of Blender’s 3D modeling techniques and environment setting. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to change an object’s meaning or message by distorting, adding to, or subtracting from the object itself. For this assignment, the goal was to “remodel” a Blender asset of our choosing to tell a different story compared to what the object was originally telling. Though recommended, we could add scenery to amply the remodel of our chosen asset. For my remodel project, I borrowed an asset from Blend Swap, a community forum dedicated to sharing Blender creations, textures, and other assets created by 3D artists, sharing them with the rest of the world. The asset in question was a Greek statue of a nude woman on her knees with her hands clenching the back of her head. It could be implied that the woman is in a state of pain or dismay, judging from the pose she is in. I changed the meaning of the statue by having her burn away, with a background of a hallway with doors revealing a light source looking behind her. The message behind the remodel is that truly, genuine love never dies. Honesty and respect toward both partners is a prioritize rather than appearances and short-term benefits. However, lust and infatuation are all things that, over time, rarely survive. Those matters will dissolve with age, and when a relationship is centered around lust and infatuation, there does not exist the aforementioned honesty and respect toward the partners. In fact, such prioritization could be the cause of long-term regret and suffering. Thus, when a man falls in love with a woman (or vice versa) with remarkable physical features, he will not think about a future with that woman. When that future does arrive, and her physical qualities deteriorate, he will leave her in darkness and abandon her. He will begin to be misogynistic towards her and shame her for her lack of beauty, leaving her in a state of fading away. Every day the woman is with the man is a “slow burn,” where she is against the clock before her physique diminishes and she is left loveless.

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> Blender was the main medium for this assignment. The importances of the program lie in the fire effect, the asset, and the environment. The program rendered the fire effect down to the smallest detail, and produced the result that I wanted: a woman with half her body burned away by the fire. The environment was just as crucial as the fire effect, as the dark (and almost sinister) appearance of the room adds to the sadness of the statue fading away. I wanted the environment to symbolize the fate of the statue, that it is possibly doomed to a hell upon death, implying that her tragic fate is correlated to the dark side of love. Blender was also dexterous at rendering minor details in the finished product, which resulted in them being the major details. The texture of the statue, the flames, and the ground turned out to be details that benefited greatly to the quality of the project and to the intenseness of the message.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> "Slow Burn" tackles the harsh reality about love. Truly genuine love never dies; the honesty that comes from a passionate relationship is treasured more than anything. As a result, people in a true and honest relationship create long-term happiness and contentment. They connect on a level that is hard for others to understand, since the bond between them is understood by them and only them. However, when a relationship is centered around lust and infatuation, that relationship will rarely survive. In fact, absolute focus on the former and latter has the possibility of leading to long-term regret and depression. This is because both parties (or potentially one person) are consumed by the idea of their partner to a point where other aspects of the relationship are dull and weak. The relationship might even be controlling and, therefore, toxic, since the demand for a partner looking their best at all times is expected more than anything. Couples who are in such a relationship are fighting against the clock, since appearances shrivel with age. Additionally, hobbies, preferences, and sexual matters are short-lived. When the clock is nearing the end, one would have realized their mistake and will cast their partner aside, leaving the partner depressed and riddled with angst. Personally speaking, I have witnessed various relationships undergo short-lived euphoria. Both with friends and in the media, I would often look past the curtains at their relationship, only to realize that they are not as happy and peachy as they seem. Such is why I have grown hesitant about entering a relationship of my own, as I do not want the focus to be around my partner’s physical appearances or the idea of them. I love my personal space, my work, and my routine. For me to break those things for someone would mean they would have to be someone special to me. Although I might be asking for much, I would prefer this someone to be supportive of and have taste in the things that I do. I have come across people like that a few times, but I have yet to be able to hold onto the feeling of love toward them. In a metaphorical scene, I would want this person to help me steer the wheel as opposed to having me pull over for them because that person is getting carsick.
