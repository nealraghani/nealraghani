<p><b>Description:</b> Slow Burn is an Art 75 project that makes use of Blender’s 3D modeling techniques and environment setting. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to change an object’s meaning or message by distorting, adding to, or subtracting from the object itself. For this assignment, the goal was to “remodel” a Blender asset of our choosing to tell a different story from what the object was telling, as well as additional features to the scenery to amply the new story. For my remodel project, I borrowed an asset from Blend Swap, a community forum dedicated to sharing Blender creations, textures, and other assets created by 3D artists and sharing them with the rest of the world. The asset in question was a Greek statue of a nude woman on her knees with her hands clenching the back of her head. It could be implied that the woman is in a state of pain or dismay, judging from the pose she is in. I changed the meaning of the statue by having her burn away, with a background of a hallway with doors revealing a light source overlooking her. The message behind the remodel was that truly, genuine love never dies. Honesty and respect towards each other is what those in love prioritize, rather than appearances and short-term benefits. On the other hand, lust and infatuation are all things that, over time, rarely survive. Those matters will dissolve with age, and when a relationship is centered around lust and infatuation, there does not exist honesty and respect towards each other. In fact, such prioritization could be the cause of long-term regret and suffering. Thus, when a man falls in love with a woman with remarkable physical features, he will not think about the future with the woman. When the future does arrive, and her physical qualities deteriorate, he will leave her in darkness and abandoned. He will begin to be misogynistic towards her and shame her for her lack of beauty, leaving her in a state of fading away. Every day the woman is with the man is a “slow burn,” where she is against the clock before her physique diminishes and she is left loveless.

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> Blender was the main medium for this assignment. Though the assignment requires the usage of Blender, the importance of Blender in my project lies in the fire fading, the asset, and the environment. The program rendered the fire down to the smallest detail, and produced the result that I wanted: a woman with half her body burned away by the fire. The environment was another crucial aspect of my remodel, as the dark and almost sinister appearance of the room adds to the sadness of the statue fading away. I wanted the environment to symbolize that the statue is possibly doomed to a hell upon death, implying that her tragic fate is correlated to the dark side of love. Blender was also dexterous at rendering minor details in the finished product, which resulted in them being the major details. The texture of the statue, the flames, and the ground turned out to be details that added to the quality of the project and intense to the message of the remodel.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> Slow Burn tackles the harsh reality about love. Truly genuine love never dies, the honesty that comes from a passionate relationship is treasured more than anything. As a result, people in a true and honest relationship create long-term happiness and contentment. They connect on a level that is hard for others to understand, since the bond between them is understood by them and only them. However, when a relationship is centered around lust and infatuation, that relationship will rarely survive. In fact, absolute focus of the former and latter has the possibility of leading to much long-term regret and depression. This is because both (or potentially one person) parties are consumed by the idea of their partner to a point where other aspects of the relationship are dull and weak. The relationship might even be controlling and, therefore, toxic, since the demand of a partner looking their best at all times is expected more than anything. Couples who are in such a relationship are fighting against the clock, since appearances shrivel with age. Additionally, hobbies, preferences, and sexual matters are short-lived. When the clock is nearing the end, one would have realized their mistake and cast their partner aside, leaving the partner in question depressed and riddled with angst. Personally speaking, I have witnessed various relationships undergo short-lived euphoria. Both with friends and in the media, I would often look past the curtains at their relationship, only to realize that they are not as happy and peachy as they seem. Such is why I have grown hesitant about entering a relationship of my own, as I do not want the focus to be around my partner’s physical appearances or the idea of them. I love my personal space, my work, and my routine. For me to break those things for someone would mean they would have to be someone special to me. Although I might be asking for much, I would prefer this someone to be supportive of the things that I do and have taste in the things that I do. I have come across people like that a few times, but I have yet to be able to hold onto the feeling of love towards them. In a metaphorical scene, I would want this person to help me steer the wheel as opposed to having to pull over because that person is getting carsick.
