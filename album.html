<p><b>Description:</b> 	"All Time Low" is a commissioned song cover art piece requested by Bay Area multi-instrumentalist and producer Chrei Torres for his reenactment of All Time Low by Jon Bellion. The song is about the emotions of a breakup and, in the midst of heartbreak, questioning one’s own existence. The song tackles the themes of hitting a low in life and letting the significant other know that life has gone downhill since the split. Specifically, according to Bellion, the heart of the themes are in the form of one’s first love and the devastation of when that love ends. Bellion describes that feeling to be a pain beyond human comprehension. Interestingly, the song captivates what it feels like to be on day three of a breakup, which makes sense as the early phases of a breakup are the most heavily taxing for any person. In the song cover art, the heart is the centerpiece as it is in the spotlight of a dark stage. The heart is seen bleeding, with a puddle of blood under it as blood droplets, taking the shape of arrows pointing down, fall from a cracked opening. The arrows are symbolic of both the “all time low” and the fact that the feeling of heartbreak is one that is kept inside. As stated before, the heart is the centerpiece of the cover, and is symbolic of the phrase “I’m bleeding out.” Because this artwork is for a song, I set the environment to be in an empty stage. 

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> The medium for this project was Photoshop, as I believed it rendered the elements that were incorporated in the project masterfully. One of the most important elements in the song cover art is the spotlight because it gives the audience an idea of the setting in the artwork. The light is also important because it illuminates the heart on an empty stage, showing how the it is handling being at an all time low. Another important element made possible through Photoshop is the appearance of the heart. I wanted the heart to appear hurt, broken, and lonely. Photoshop best demonstrated the heart's pain through the blood droplets and the crack on the heart. I wanted the droplets to add to the feeling of heartbreak, which was done by designing them to take upon the shape of a downward arrow. Although not explicitly implied in the artwork, the heart was chosen as the focal point because there are many album covers that feature them. One album cover that was used as inspiration was Kanye West’s 808’s and Heartbreaks. Being such a widely acclaimed album, the album cover has also cemented itself in mainstream media. Being a recognized element, a heart would be the centerpiece for the song cover art for both its popularity and context to the Bellion song.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> The song cover art for All Time Low illustrates the themes of heartbreak and the emotions that occur after a breakup. People respond to heartbreak in different ways, but suffice it to say that both parties experience varying forms of hurt. While physical pain can be seen from both people as an outsider, greater pain occurs emotionally. Thus, heartbreak can only be understood by those who endure it, especially when it occurs during the early phases. When discussing heartbreak or, in the context of the song, hitting an all time low, those who experience it make great mention of their heart and how their heart hurts. They might use phrases such as “my heart is swelling” or “my heart is bleeding,” which are over exaggerations of their pain. Such statements are the core of my song art, and physical projections I set aside in this project. The spotlight that illuminates the broken heart is an element that also acts as the core of my art, as it gives the audience an indication of the setting and the emotion of it. Because All Time Low by Jon Bellion is a song about sadness, to have the environment match the emotion of the song was paramount. The environment is a stage, which is in reference to the purpose of the artwork. The heart is the performer as it conveys its true emotions. As stated before, the spotlight also serves to portray the emotion of the environment, which it does so by implying the dark and lonely nature of it.
