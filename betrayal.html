<p><b>Description:</b> For this proposal, Everyone I Love is Here, I wanted to base my work on an emotion that has significantly impacted me, both positively and negatively: the feeling of being betrayed. If one is a victim of such, betrayal is akin to feeling left out and as though one is not good enough. It can happen for several reasons; one feels differently about a subject than their peers, envy towards you, maturity, or finding ones behavior or qualities unusual to others liking. People have different emotions in response to being betrayed, but the most common sentiment is anger; the victim feels like they are fading away from their peers acknowledgment. The victim may also want to hurt their peers but knows they cannot because such violence is not the correct response. Anger is connected with fire, as displayed in many famous art pieces, and fire can be either big or small, indicating grand or minuscule energy. The same applies to anger. The most challenging thing about betrayal is learning how and when to let go of your peers. One might have built a solid foundation with their peers, telling them secrets they usually would not with others. You may have spent money and sacrificed time to be with friends rather than focus on essential matters. Betrayal can make one think those memories were for nothing, and it is not unreasonable to think so. However, in the grand scheme of things, those memories have important lessons masked behind them, and it is up to the victim to realize those lessons to move on and emotionally mature from those experiences. For this reason, doing nothing is the most optimal response when being betrayed.

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> The discipline I have chosen with Everyone I Love is Here is sculpting, using Blender to help me achieve the final result. Over the course of attending SJSU, I have grown to have a solid attachment to using Blender for interior modeling and environment design. Although I am aspiring to learn it, character modeling is what I am not dexterous over, and such is why I used statue renders from Blend Swap, a Blender community forum dedicated to sharing works from various artists for free use. The expressions and positions of the figures were essential when considering which ones to use. I wanted each of them to fit with the narrative of betrayal to tell a story about betrayal. For the grassy, sunny environment, I wanted it to closely match where I live and what I see near my own house. Generally speaking, people find a lot of balance and peace when they’re in the comfort of their hometown and the nature they grew up in, and because I live near grassy hills with a lovely sunset, I find myself at peace whenever I am home. Creating the environment was the second most challenging part of the work. The most difficult part of this work was the house. Inspired by assets and textures from my home, I tried to provide as much realism as possible when constructing the walls, shutters, doors, and crown molding (even though it did not make its way to the final render). With the environment and the house together, I wanted to create the theme of a childhood home, an environment that, as I see it, instills the calmest and most nostalgia in the viewer. The statues are arranged and selected to resemble children in funny positions while a parent is taking a picture. As said previously, I also chose the poses of the statues to tell a story about betrayal. Lighting, too, was necessary, specifically from the sunset. Not only was it an element of nostalgia from my life, but the lighting from it gave just the right amount of illumination to the texture of the walls and the statues themselves.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> The premise around Everyone I Love is Here is based on the emotion of feeling betrayed and what one goes through when treated that way. I want my work to resonate with others who may have had experiences in their life where peers, acquaintances backstabbed them or even loved ones. Regardless of who enacts betrayal, it can leave a victim in a disorganized, depressed, or rabid state of mind, where they feel as though all people have ill intent and no one would want to be around them. I firmly believe that the worst thing anyone can do to a person is making them feel left out because of something they cannot control, an experience I have endured in the past. Everyone is worthy of belonging; everyone is worthy of being loved and accepted. No one should feel as though all humans are like those who have done them wrong, and it is essential to learn from that experience to mature emotionally. As depicted in the statue, the feeling of hurting ex-friends is powerful in the heat of the moment. It is best, however, to do nothing and move on from there. It is better to leave them alone and recover rather than display violence and regret doing so in the future. The world can be unforgiving to those with pure intent, and people will try to make others change because they do not like certain qualities. I also want my work to illuminate the fact that one should not adjust themselves to fit in. Every person is different in every regard, and trusting in your natural qualities and never being afraid to show them is the most crucial trait of a human. In sum, I want my work to ring true to people’s past experiences and let them know, through further reflection, that it is okay to feel that way; it’s okay to feel as though you are fading away from your peers, and it’s certainly normal to feel the fire of revenge. However, one would need to ask themselves whether leaving bruises on people who did wrong is worth just simply letting go. To ex-friends (perpetrators of betrayal) viewing this work, I want them to ask themselves if they believe lying to others to protect their feelings is better than telling the victim how they feel about them.
