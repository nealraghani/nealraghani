<p><b>Description:</b> House on the Hill is an Art 75 project that serves as the last Blender project before the final examination. The project utilizes Blender to create an environment, making use of various 3D modeling techniques taught to the class by the instructor. The requirement was to incorporate various elements from nature to create a realistic environment. Mountains, grass, water, and the sky were among the many elements we could integrate in our finished project. For my environment, I chose to create a grassy, hilly environment with a house overlooking a sunset, all of which were inspired by my home in California. Although my house is not in a hilly environment, it overlooks hills and I often listen to farm animals in the morning. Additionally, I often find myself admiring the sunset whenever I go on walks along my neighborhood, which amplifies the feeling of home. Speaking of which, the feeling of home is what provides me the most balance and peace whenever I am away or even working on projects. Home is what allows me to remain consistent with my work and my routine. There were many points in my life where I felt stressed and anxious for one reason or another. I would often overthink and lose myself in the midst of my own thinking. But, when I am at home or thinking about home, I begin to feel at ease with myself and I return to consistency and balance.

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> The main medium for this project was Blender, as the tools the program provided best simulated the idea I had for the project.  Specifically, simulating the sunset and the grassy hills was the main priority for this assignment, and assuring that both were rendered with detail was paramount. Lighting from the sunset was an element I am surprised Blender rendered out quite well, as the attention to detail with the shadows and the glistening from the house and hills added to the environmentâ€™s aesthetic. Another important element from Blender that played a major role was the camera feature. Capturing the sunset and the house together in addition to the lighting was what I prioritized with the camera. The photograph rendered with immaculate detail, containing all the elements I created in the desired position.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> The significance behind the Blender environment is that it is inspired by aspects of my neighborhood. Although the finished product does not look exactly like my home, many elements were inspired by aspects of my home. One of the most symbolic elements that was used in the environment as inspiration were the hills. My home overlooks hills, and I often view the color of the grass changing on them depending on the season. A lot of the time, I hear cows walking along the hills and making noises. One could come to the conclusion that the grassy hilled environment played a major role in my life in remembering what home and nature looks like. That conclusion would most certainly be true. Another element that played a major role in my life was the sunset I would often also overlook. The golden, blue yellow sky is whatI often think about when recalling home, as I would admire the sunset by sitting outside with my family. Inside, when the sun would set, my family and I would watch TV and sit in the living room area talking about anything that came to mind. The color of the sunset would change color depending on the season, sometimes taking the appearance of a golden red or pink sunset. The sunset glistening over the hills is what I fondly remember most when thinking about it. The grassy hills and the sunset together instill the most calm when I remember home, and would often be what I miss about home when I am away. The balance and peace home would give me, whether I think about it or I return there, provides a sense of warmth and focus when I stress about matters. If I am under pressure or if I need closure, I would think about home and the elements that stand out to me. Although not incorporated into the project, community is an element I look back on when remembering home, as community has existed since I moved to my home back in 2008. Since then, the neighbors that lived across and next to us, and those around neighboring streets, became family. We would alternate where we host events and what we would do as a community, and such is what I find that provides me fond memories of my neighborhood.
