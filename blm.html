<p><b>Description:</b> When Will it Be Alright is my project proposal regarding social justice, specifically on Black Lives Matter. With this project, I wanted to ask when it will be all right; when will black Americans feel safe from the prejudice enacted by white Americans and be free from the fear that the world is biased against them? In other words, when will the killing of these innocent lives end? True, countless programs, activists, and communities are dedicated to the prosperity of African American life, not just in the United States but in the entire world. Suffice it to say that the many movements that followed before the George Floyd movement, such as the Black Panther movement and Martin Luther King Jr.'s enactment of peace, have been monumental in black history. However, with such events, the slaughter of black innocents and racial discrimination still runs rampant, even after the George Floyd incident. Some can say that pain, though it is hurting, exists to develop and improve ourselves so we can be the best version of ourselves. However, when people keep killing one another without justification and do not learn from their mistakes, they do not create development, only hatred. This statement is the focal point of the proposal in the form of the George Floyd caricature on the left. There, eighty victims of police brutality and police murder are present, forming to shape the image of George Floyd, showing that it took more than eighty lives to be taken by police unjustly to realize that such actions are not okay. Because African American murders are projected all over the media, I chose the setting of my project to be a newspaper article. Additionally, Daily News has featured many opinion-based articles regarding the justification of innocent African American lives being taken (along with standard news reports), which is why I chose the Daily News format. Excerpts from one of these articles are on the bottom right, and an image taken during one of the George Floyd protests is on the top right. Lastly, the quote underneath, "when will it be alright" is part of the hook of one of the decade's most famous songs, Alright by Kendrick Lamar. Protesters also used this hook as part of a chant during the Black Lives Matter movement.

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> The discipline that I have chosen for this project is photography, using Adobe Photoshop to achieve the final result. I decided on photography for this project because it has been used by photographers and other artists to effectively tell the history of African Americans over the past two centuries. Artists and other occupations have said that a picture is worth a thousand words and that saying is never more accurate in the context of black history. Photos have told stories about black movements, people, organizations, and places, and the narrative each one of them holds was pivotal in societal history. Although I lack photography skills as an artist, I have used the photographic works of many talented photographers. Not only have they captured black history in a way no other news outlet or communication has before, but their factoring of positioning and lighting makes their works better than what I can produce. To create the setting, I used this newspaper image from Pinterest and cropped it in Photoshop to make it more visible and easier to read for the audience. Because I wanted to add my messages to the paper, the issue came with how I would do so without ruining the image itself. Before I could do that, however, I had to create the focal point of the project: the caricature of George Floyd, which was the most challenging part of the project. Using the popular image of George Floyd, I wanted the image to be composed of all the previous victims of police brutality and police murder. I liked the pictures of those victims before George Floyd’s death to amplify the message further. Using BlackPast, I gathered one hundred photos of victims and aligned them individually to cover Floyd’s image. Though I could only manage eighty photos, I was able to size them to create the caricature. Lastly, using a series of blending options, I achieved the result: the image of George Floyd made up of eighty victims of unfair treatment by police. After completing the caricature, I placed it on the left-hand side to make it the focal point of the project. I also got a photo from a Daily News article regarding one of the George Floyd protests that left property burning. Placing that image and an excerpt on the right-hand side, I was ready to blend the photos in with the paper, creating a rusty, paper-like texture to match the newspaper material. One of the most challenging parts of this project was editing the placeholder text from the original paper and replacing it with my own. I used the clone stamp tool and began to paint over the text using pixels from the newspaper that did not have text. Afterward, I filled the spaces with my text with similar fonts to the previous ones and adjusted the color and material of both the images and paper to create the finished result.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> Although I am a white American, I felt obligated to do this project because of my experiences of feeling alienated from people and, for lack of a better word, being different. Additionally, I felt urged to project my stance on Black Lives Matter due to my mom’s side of the family. She was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa, and was born as a white African. During her childhood, she witnessed the events of Apartheid, seeing countless Africans being killed and beaten. Moving to the U.S., she has come to deeply treasure and learn about the humanity and history of black Americans, something her dad has forbidden. Moving to the U.S. also meant she would raise a family and share her experiences living in South Africa during a rough time in history. Thus, after hearing about her experiences witnessing Apartheid, I felt obligated to create this proposal to be part of that majority that believes in the right. One of the three biggest inspirations to complete this work was my mom. The second biggest inspiration was Mario’s project proposal, Indignation. I deeply admired his work in the creation of my project and his ability to tell a story. He used the faces of victims and the scenery with the changing of colors until it fades to black. Using the idea of victims of violence from past events and story-telling, I used BlackPast to collect my images of black victims of police violence and form them to create George Floyd’s photo. This caricature would be the focal point of my project. The third biggest inspiration for this project was  the song Alright by Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly. Before the album’s release (2015), there had been several killings of innocent black men, women, and children to where it was difficult to feel “alright,” as the song told the audience. Having felt that way, I wanted my message to be in the form of a question: when will it be all right?
