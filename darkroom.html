<p><b>Description:</b> The Room is a 3D environment created as the final examination for Art 74: Intro to Digital Media. The project combines modeling techniques in Blender that the class has learned along with other advanced editing techniques, namely the usage of textures and lighting. Inspiration for this project came in the forms of various horror video games and movies, as the themes of isolation and dark rooms remain consistent in those medias. However, the bulk of the inspiration derived from what many have thought an insane asylum might look like. Prison cells and psyche wards were also taken into account, since those places have negative and evil connotations behind them. One of the most integral elements of this project was the attention to the camera angle, as I wanted to achieve the perspective of a person walking into the room without knowing any information or context as to where they are and who arrived before them. Many horror video video games are played from the point of view of the main character, and the player feels as though they are the ones in the world of the game. This point of view technique produces the most frightening results, and leaves chills amongst the players. The posters, table, and books are also important elements integrated into the 3D environment, as it, again, leaves the audience wondering who was here before them. To some viewers, these objects might leave them feeling as though someone or something is watching them, which adds to the sense of mystery and horror the environment possesses. The combination of the point of view camera angle, the object, and the darkness of the room, come together to create the unknown. People often fear what they do not understand, which is instilled by the possibility of something watching them as they enter the room. What this person or thing was doing prior is only up to our imaginations, which also instills a chill down the audience’s spines, as they could be something dangerous with evil intent.

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> The medium that I chose for this project was Blender. With consideration of the theme and elements incorporated to the final project, Blender was able to best simulate that. Additionally, a 3D horror-based environment would simulate perfectly the emotions and potential reactions of unease and anxiety, since many horror-based media stems from 3D environments. A major reason as to why Blender was the best 3D medium to use for this project was because the programs have the ability to render details masterfully. This fact is made especially evident by the use of the concrete texture of the room, the wood texture of the table, and the creases on the posters. I believe that, when creating a 3D environment, attention to detail is paramount. If a program does not render such details efficiently, then the finished product will appear sloppy. Another noteworthy attribute of Blender is its ability to render lighting. The singular light acts as a key element to the environment, and rendering it out correctly was of utmost importance. Blender’s proficiency at lighting resulted in the environment appearing haunted and mysterious, almost looking as though a prison cell. Such was the goal for the end result.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> The Room is designed to be a dark, unknown area that instills paranoia and unease into the audience, unknowing of who or what could have been here before the audience. The environment incorporates elements of fear and the unknown, inspired by a trait commonly used to describe fear: “we often fear what we do not understand.” Throughout our lives, there have been many things that have troubled us that we never understood. These things could have been people, places, or objects that have given us a tense feeling of discomfort or paranoia. Additionally, the fear of the unknown could be seen in various forms of media. Prominent examples could be seen in various urban legends, movies, or historical events. However the unknown appears in our lives, whether through word of mouth or visually, we often choose to look away from such anomalies for our own or other’s safety. An interesting notion about the unknown is that it convinces people the potential reality of the supernatural. Ghosts, creatures of terror, or even religious figures also appear as unknown entities that make us question the secrets of our world and what is possible. As a result of such fear raised by the unknown, we often abide by good deeds or keep to ourselves from encountering them. The unknown could also exist in everyday aspects of life, which result in the prevention of risk takers becoming too reckless. One might fear going into a casino to earn or lose money, a driver might fear going on a certain path, or an introvert might fear the outdoors. What such fears have in common are that the reward is never clear. We fear the reward because there are outcomes that could affect us positively or negatively. Loss of money, a flat tire, or nervousness from other people are but a few examples of matters that could go wrong in everyday scenarios, and matters we are overly cautious of. Whether the unknown is an urban legend, scary story, or a new experience, the commonality exists in people fearing the negative outcome.
