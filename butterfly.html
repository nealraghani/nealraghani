<p><b>Description:</b> 	The Urban Legend of the Butterfly Man is the final exam project for Art 75: Intro to Digital Video. This exam serves as the basis of what we have learned in the class, combining editing techniques and storytelling that were taught in class by our instructor. The Urban Legend of the Butterfly Man tells the story about Theo Von Letterman, a researcher from Massachusetts. He and his team of other researchers were given the project of researching Asian tribes, examining their cultural practices and history. Their research soon led the team to Burma (now Myanmar), a Southeastern Asian nation in the gaze of the Rakhine people. As part of the research protocols, the team examined the tribe, who were welcoming and kind to the foreigners. Upon examination of their practices, which included dancing and singing, Letterman and his team were surprised to discover that the Rakhine people often told stories amongst each other. Some of these stories were passed down from family to family for years. One of these stories, an urban legend about a Butterfly Man, was said to be a story every child was taught to recognize and remember. This Butterfly Man is said to be a prolific being born every one hundred years sent by the gods. If they showed signs of being the next Butterfly Man, they would be sheltered and protected by the Rakhine people to defend them from bullying and the various evils in the world. This being is said to possess knowledge and wisdom beyond human comprehension, paving the way for enlightenment and prosperity for the next century of humans. Curious, Letterman interviews the current Butterfly Man, Pablo, to learn of his wisdoms in hopes to share them with the rest of the world. After the research, Letterman and his team return to Massachusetts to share their research and Pablo’s interview to the nation. After a heated disagreement between Letterman and government officials, he is imprisoned for possessing, what they believe, is dangerous information. In denial, Letterman records his findings discreetly in hopes that his work prospers to future generations for the greater good.

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> Because of the project expectations (and expectations I set for myself), I found myself transitioning through various mediums for this project. However, the medium that was most crucial for this project was Adobe Premiere Pro. Adobe Premiere Pro served wonderfully in composing the clips and creating the necessary transitions to match what one would see in a 1900s film. The projects leading up to the final have taught me that leveling of sound is paramount in the finished product. I often found myself discovering that the previous projects I created possessed an uneven sound leveling, and Adobe Premiere Pro was proficient as producing the leveling I desired. To create the crackling background noise and vintage video filter, I used Adobe After Effects. Although I have researched the former and latter examples in Premiere Pro, they did not produce the effects I desired. After Effects, on the other hand, did, and I was able to incorporate those elements to my Premiere Pro composition. To create the vintage voice effect, I used Adobe Audition, which I have become familiar with after the sound project in Art 75. Using a high quality microphone, I was able to easily adjust the levels of the voice recording to mimic a 1900s microphone. Because The Urban Legend of the Butterfly Man is inspired by the story of Buddha, much research and note-taking was done to ensure the structure of my story was strong and made sense. Additional research was done on Burmese tribes and their cultures, and my attention landed on the Rakhine people, since they often told stories amongst each other and practiced other cultural activities like dancing and singing. Lastly, reading of Asian philosophical works by Lao Tzu and Buddha were critical in the final examination, as those works would serve as the main message behind The Urban Legend of the Butterfly Man.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> 	The Urban Legend of the Butterfly Man’s message is that humans are too focused on the past and the future, and are not attentive about the present. As a result, they live in dread and anxiety about their expectations, fears, and mistakes instead of prioritizing their own development in the present moment. Additionally, humans also prioritize short-term happiness, chasing after money, security, and other assets that will not mean much in the grand scheme of things. Because of their thirst for proving themselves by emphasizing on those assets, their ambitions get the better of them, and their minds are never free. Lastly, people are too attentive of other’s approval, which leaves them at every disadvantage against said approval, as both parties will never be satisfied. I, for one, have been trapped in these states of mind in the past, and I often found myself at war against my mind. As I tried to fill the void with other’s perspectives and other satisfactory assets, I was left depressed and unable to sleep due to my unhealthy obsession. I believe people should learn the messages provided in The Urban Legend of the Butterfly Man, as such wisdom will unlock themselves from the matrix of today’s society. It will be difficult to fully accept the messages demonstrated by the short film, since many are coated by their own ego and do not want to be told otherwise. However, letting go of the ego will gain a new perspective of what the world offers and how to make the most out of living. The messages will also be difficult to grasp because of the fear of judgment from other people. As a result of viewing life from the lens of the messages in the video, others will view those as outsiders or potentially weird. Others would have lost themselves in expectations and their own ego, while the ones seeing “the truth” do not concern themselves with satisfying others or filling a void with unnecessary possessions. Such is what The Urban Legend of the Butterfly Man classifies as being a free human. The free human focuses on the present and appreciates the beauty of nature and life.
