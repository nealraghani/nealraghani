<p><b>Description:</b> Since I was in 7th grade, I have always had much fun creating art. Art class helped me reinforce my love for art, and I was always challenged with each art project I made. However, out of all the projects I have made over the years, Confession is the hardest one I have made. Never, in my life, would I think I would eventually create a project with such a message, nor did I think a project such as this would scare me the way that it did. The first reason as to why Confession was hard to complete was simply because I am not polished in my drawing skills. Drawing has not always been easy for me, and such is what I am continuously working on. On the other hand, I felt as though my drawing skills in this project were better than previous times I drew. The second reason as to why this particular project was difficult was, again, the message. Last year, in August of 2021, my family and I flew to Cancun for two weeks for their wedding anniversary. During the time we were there, we stayed at the Moon Palace Resort, which was the largest hotel I have ever stayed at. After exploring the area for a few days, I found an abandoned church that, according to the sign hung at the door, was going to be open in the future. Not thinking much of it, I went back to my room and continued to have fun. Things took a mental turn as, after a dinner with my parents, saying how proud they were of me, I began to enter into my overthinking and became overly anxious that night. In need of closure, I went to that abandoned church and began confessing secrets that I kept away from my parents and other loved ones in front of a Jesus statue. I began asking for forgiveness, as I said I was sorry for my addiction towards adult content, my envy towards the good of others, my fear towards time, and my mentality of sometimes not taking life seriously. After staying in the church, contemplating my thoughts, I went back to my room and relaxed. During freshman year of college, after hearing of a therapy team at SJSU, I took the opportunity to meet with them, learning things about myself I never did, and gaining insight into how to better myself.

<p><b>Discipline & Materials:</b> The main medium that I chose for this project was painting in Photoshop with the help of specific brushes used to enforce the atmosphere and message. I started with a sketch of the painting, and composed the end result in Photoshop. As stated above, drawing is a challenge for me, so I wanted to provide myself the difficulty of dexterously juggling both execution and memory. During this project, I was inspired by Fancisco Goyas Black Paintings. In these paintings, he expresses his fears, discomfort, and anxiety towards his mortality and the current state of Spain, his country of origin. I felt a strange sense of relation towards his paintings, as I fear my own recklessness at times, and it was not until  2021 where I decided to seek guidance in order to alleviate these fears. Because of this inspiration, I decided to utilize painting for this project, no matter how clumsy I am at it. I was also inspired by cave paintings that I have viewed in the past in documentaries and photos. The stories that they have told in their artwork carries much history in how people of the past thought and conveyed emotions. Utilizing the skills I already possess, I focused more on telling the story than the execution of the artwork (even though both are equally as important). The most important aspects of Confession are the elements I chose to express what I am sorry for, which I took inspiration from in Jan Matejkos Stanczyk. His painting is very powerful and emotionally charged, as depicted by the clown sitting down in dismay as opposed to doing his job in entertaining his audience. The theme with my elements is that I wanted them to be figures of tragedy and guilt, showing a display of evil that could destroy anyone consumed by them. However, by acknowledging the enemy, one has the ability to defeat the enemy.

<p><b>Artist Statement:</b> My artwork, from its title, is about the overcoming of the evils I carried: addiction, envy, anxiety, and denial. Confession is the most human art piece I have made because it tackles what many people in the world faced or are currently experiencing. Oftentimes, these evils are what destroy the relationships between them and loved ones. There are many ways in which people have confronted them, and both have the result of making their life better. There are those who pray and connect with God; those who seek therapy or friends; there are those who write in a log or draw out their fears. Keeping those fears silent and in ones head only strengthens the issue, as it becomes more daunting to deal with them. Though I painted this piece with only myself in mind, I feel as though others can relate to what I have made. Everyone has matters that they keep to themselves, and it is not unreasonable that this is so. Suffice it to say that if any of these issues came to light in the ears of my friends and family, they would be disgusted. However, the power of portraying those insecurities onto something physical is immense, and does more help than one would realize. My overall message for this work, in the grand scheme of things, is that we are all human; we are not perfect in areas we wish to be. People undergo rough periods in their lives, just as I had undergone. As someone who had an addiction to adult content, I felt embarrassed and ashamed that I had been consumed by such a thing. On top of other insecurities, I did not know who to confront. But, through the struggling, there is light at the end of the tunnel. With regards to the medium and discipline, my other goal was to highlight how I felt when finally faced with the reality of my insecurities. A popular saying amongst artists is that a picture is worth a thousand words. While this is, much like the above quote, true, the authenticity of painting a story and emotion, I believe, makes this statement especially true. There is something special about the mind and hands working harmoniously to produce an end result that means much more than anyone can know. Oftentimes, such can be the result of long-term satisfaction and contentment.
